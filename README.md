# Suicide Analysis Report Using Power BI

## Introduction

Suicide is a serious global public health issue. This report delves into the data to analyze suicide rates across various factors, aiming to raise awareness and identify potential areas for further investigation. It's important to remember that suicide is a complex phenomenon with no single cause, and the data presented here may suggest correlations, but not definitive causation.

## Data Source

The data for this report comes from public data source Kaggle site.

## Methodology

The data was analyzed using Power BI, a business intelligence tool. Visualizations were created to explore suicide rates by country, generation, gender, employment status, and economic indicators. Filters were added to allow for interactive exploration by year and country.

## Findings

1. **Suicide Rates by Country**

   The bar chart shows the number of suicides per country. Highlighting countries with the highest rates can prompt further analysis of social, economic, or cultural factors that might be contributing.

2. **Suicide Rates by Generation**

   The bar chart examines suicide rates across different age groups. This helps identify which generations might be more vulnerable and can guide targeted prevention efforts.

3. **Country-Wise Population**

   This chart provides context for suicide rates relative to population size. Countries with large populations might naturally have higher total suicide numbers, but the rate per capita should be considered for a more accurate comparison.

4. **GDP Growth by Year**

   The bar chart explores the relationship between economic growth and suicide rates. It's important to remember that correlation does not imply causation, and other factors might be at play.

5. **Suicide Rate Year-over-Year (YoY)**

   The line chart tracks trends in suicide rates over time. Identifying periods of increase or decrease can signal the need for further investigation into potential contributing factors.

6. **Inflation Rate by Country**

   The chart investigates the potential link between inflation and suicide rates. High inflation can create financial stress, which might be a contributing factor for some individuals.

7. **Male vs. Female**

   The donut chart shows the gender distribution of suicides. Understanding the gender disparity can inform prevention strategies tailored to specific needs.

8. **Employment vs. Unemployment**

   The donut chart analyzes the association between employment status and suicide rates. Unemployment can be a source of stress and insecurity, potentially increasing suicide risk.

## Limitations

- **Data quality:** The accuracy of the findings depends on the reliability of the data source.
- **Data limitations:** The data might not capture all relevant factors contributing to suicide.
- **Correlation vs. causation:** The visualizations may suggest correlations, but further research is needed to establish causal relationships.

- ## Visualizations

The dashboard includes the following visualizations:

- **Bar Chart: Suicide by Country Name**
  - Displays the number of suicides per country.
  - Consider filtering by region or income level for deeper analysis.

- **Bar Chart: Suicide by Generation**
  - Analyzes suicide rates across different age groups (e.g., Millennials, Gen X, Baby Boomers).
  - Explore potential generational factors.

- **Country-Wise Population**
  - Provides context for suicide rates relative to population size.

- **Bar Chart: GDP Growth by Year**
  - Examines the relationship between economic growth and suicide rates (correlation does not imply causation).

- **Line Chart: Suicide Rate Year-over-Year (YoY)**
  - Tracks trends in suicide rates over time.
  - Consider adding a moving average to smooth out fluctuations.

- **Inflation Rate by Country**
  - Investigates the potential link between inflation and suicide rates.

- **Donut Chart: Male vs. Female**
  - Shows the gender distribution of suicides.
  - Explore potential gender-specific risk factors.

- **Donut Chart: Employment vs. Unemployment**
  - Analyzes the association between employment status and suicide rates.
  - Consider limitations of the data and potential confounding factors.

- **Filters by Year and Country**
  - Allows users to interactively explore the data by specific timeframes and locations.

## Additional Considerations

- **Data Quality:** Ensure the data source is reliable and up-to-date. Consider data cleaning or transformation steps as needed.
- **Data Ethics:** Handle sensitive information with care. Anonymize data when possible and avoid drawing definitive conclusions from correlations.
- **Mental Health Resources:** Include a section with resources for suicide prevention and mental health support hotlines.

## Conclusion

This report provides a preliminary analysis of suicide data across various factors. It emphasizes the importance of considering data quality, ethical handling of sensitive information, and the need for further research to understand the complex causes of suicide. By raising awareness and identifying potential areas for investigation, this report contributes to the ongoing efforts in suicide prevention.

## Recommendations

1. Further research is needed to explore the causal relationships between the factors analyzed in this report.
2. The use of disclaimers can reinforce that the report is for informational purposes only and does not replace professional medical advice.

This report serves as a foundation for further exploration of suicide and its contributing factors, In hope that we can work towards creating effective prevention strategies and saving lives.
